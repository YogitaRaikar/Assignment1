INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE PROGRAM-
1.Consider two files to give input to the program. The files should have elements in sorted order. Two files can have common elements as well as files can have multiples of same elements.
2.Consider another empty file to get the output in that file.
3.In the command line specify in this format ./a.out filename1 filename2 filename3. Here filename1 and filename2 has elements(numbers) to give input to the program, filename3 is empty initially and saves the output after the program is excecuted.
4.To view the output, open output file(filename3).

DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT
1.Create file1 which contains for example 0,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,18,19,19,29
2.Create file2 which contains for example -3,-3,0,1,2,3,15,16,18,18,18,19,20,25,29
3.Create file3 which is empty.
4.Run the program and open file3 to see the output.
5.Output for the above example is 
          AUB: {-3,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,15,16,18,19,20,25,29}
          A^B: {0,1,2,3,18,19,29}
          A-B: {4,5,6,7,8}

CHALLENGES FACED 
1.We didn’t know how to input from files in our program and also get the output in another file. 
2.In order to get the total number comparison operations was also a challenge.
3.Resolving the errors.
4.Uploading on GitHub was also a problem as this was the first time we were doing it.

HOW WE FACED THE CHALLENGES
We did a lot of research individually and then worked together as a team on this assignment. We compiled all our ideas and worked on the coding and then tested with different cases. We then watched videos to understand how to work and use GitHub.

WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT
We learnt to work together coordinately. We learnt how to read input from file and also write in a file. We learnt how to trace out through loops and find errors in the code. We also learnt to use GitHub.
